TO DO:
-Setup SMTP and test SMTP mail services
-Generalize Documents CV control
-Generalize Comments CV control
-export and search codebase for lilly and MCK and McKesson
x-REST API connector, export jar, get services working
x-Document search not working - might've accidentally deleted parts of query (check against MCK) - just had to fully restart BAW server



FUTURE:
-Examine ServiceDataTable control .js and see if there is a way to capture the error in the "On service data error:" event - perhaps from view._instance.?
